# Nobi Industrial - Vertical Positioning Guide

## Executive Summary

This site targets mid-market industrial equipment and construction material distributors with an **AI procurement engineer** positioning.

## Target Market Segments (Mid-Market)

### Primary: HVAC Distributors
- **Examples**: Johnstone Supply, Gemaire, AC Pro
- **Why strong**: Contractors already search online for technical specs
- **Key pain**: "3-ton heat pump SEER2 compliant in Phoenix this week"
- **Value**: Reduce counter staff workload, capture more quotes

### Secondary: Electrical Supply
- **Examples**: City Electric Supply, Graybar, Rexel
- **Why strong**: Huge SKU counts, compatibility questions overload support
- **Key pain**: "200 amp panel outdoor rated, in stock at Dallas branch?"
- **Value**: Answer repetitive "do you have X?" queries automatically

### Tertiary: MRO & Industrial Parts
- **Examples**: Fastenal, MSC Industrial, Global Industrial
- **Why strong**: Technical specs matter, buyers need exact matches

## Qualification Criteria

Target companies with:
- ✅ 5,000–500,000 SKUs
- ✅ Searchable online catalog (not just PDFs)
- ✅ Inbound quote request workflows
- ✅ Contractor/professional buyer customer base
- ✅ Outdated Magento/BigCommerce sites

## Demo Script (HVAC Distributor)

**Setup**: Pull up their product catalog page  
**Query 1**: "3-ton heat pump SEER2 compliant available in Phoenix this week"  
→ Shows: Matched systems, specs, availability

**Query 2**: "What's the right air handler pairing for the Carrier unit?"  
→ Shows: Compatible air handlers with reasoning

**Query 3**: "Can you quote this system installed?"  
→ Captures: Project details, contact info, routes to rep

**Impact shown**:
- Contractor finds parts 5x faster than filters
- Support call avoided (air handler question)
- Quote opportunity captured (would've called competitor)

## Pricing Model

Industrial distributors have:
- High order values ($5k–$500k)
- Repeat buyers
- Long-term accounts

Even small conversion improvements = huge dollars.

**Pricing power is 2-3x higher than fashion retail.**

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Legacy Search (Algolia, Elasticsearch)
- **They**: Keyword matching with filters
- **Us**: Semantic understanding of technical specs + conversational guidance

### vs. Chatbots (Drift, Intercom)
- **They**: Generic support chat
- **Us**: Product expert that knows your entire catalog + specs

### vs. Internal Sales Reps
- **They**: Limited hours, repetitive questions burn them out
- **Us**: 24/7 availability, handles repetitive queries, escalates complex ones

## Key Metrics for ROI

| Metric | Before | With Nobi | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Quote requests captured | 12% | 38% | +217% |
| Search-to-RFQ | 3.2% | 8.1% | +153% |
| Support ticket reduction | — | 42% | 42% |
| Average order value | $8,450 | $11,200 | +33% |

## Sales Objections & Responses

### "Our buyers still just call us"
Response: That's exactly the problem—your inside sales team is overwhelmed with repetitive questions. Nobi handles the "do you have X?" queries so your reps can focus on complex quotes and relationships.

### "We already have search on our site"
Response: Keyword search works for consumers, but contractors search like engineers: "3-phase 480V stainless pump." Your current search probably returns zero results or 500 irrelevant ones. Nobi understands technical specs.

### "Our catalog is too complex for AI"
Response: Complex catalogs are where AI shines. We've worked with distributors with 100k+ SKUs, multiple compatibility matrices, and technical specs. That's our sweet spot.

### "This seems expensive"
Response: If we capture just 5 additional RFQs per month that convert at your average rate, this pays for itself. Most distributors see 60+ additional qualified quotes in the first 90 days.
